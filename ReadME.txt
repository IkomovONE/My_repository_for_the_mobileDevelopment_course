Hello,

When I was making my project, I was using Android Studio. And for running my project, I highly recommend you to open it through Android Studio as well. As this is a mobile development course, you should open it through android emulator. 

How to open my project through emulator in android studio:

1) Make sure you have Flutter installed
2) Make sure you have Android Studio installed and flutter configured in Android Studio.
3) Create an emulator in the Android Studio. The phone model used for emulator should not matter, but I used Google Pixel 5, and I recommend you to do that as well.
4) Open my project through Android Studio, open emulator, then launch the project on that emulator.
5) You can see how I open my project through Android Studio in the YouTube video I uploaded, the link to the video is in my repository. 


Also, it is possible to launch the project on the real device. For doing that, you could go to Android Studio, there choose build-flutter-build APK. That way an APK package is going to be built for installing on an android. Look for the messages on the console, it deploys the APK to the specific path, you could take it from there and install it on android.

Best regards,
